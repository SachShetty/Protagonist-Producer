Protagonist Producer is an OpenAI API app that lets you create a character. By typing in a brief idea, you get back a character portrait, a character name and a synopsis/backstory for your character using OpenAI API for Text-Davinci-003 and DALLÂ·E.

### Steps to run:
1. Paste your OpenAI API key in string format in inplace of "Your OpenAI API Key" in 'env_sample.js'

2. Then rename 'env_sample.js' file to 'env.js'
3. Type the command in the terminal of the Protagonist-Producer folder
